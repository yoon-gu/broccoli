    "Routing lets us dynamically choose underlying query pipelines to use given the query and a set of choices.\n",

    "We offer this as an out-of-the-box abstraction in our [Router Query Engine](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/query_engine/RouterQueryEngine.html) guide. Here we show you how to compose a similar pipeline using our Query Pipeline syntax - this allows you to not only define query engines but easily stitch it into a chain/DAG with other modules across the compute graph."
